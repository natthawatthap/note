There are various sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here is a list of some common sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort:**
   - Simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Selection Sort:**
   - In-place comparison sort that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region.

3. **Insertion Sort:**
   - Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

4. **Merge Sort:**
   - A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.

5. **Quick Sort:**
   - Another divide and conquer algorithm. It selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

6. **Heap Sort:**
   - Builds a max-heap (or min-heap) from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap, resulting in a sorted array.

7. **Counting Sort:**
   - Non-comparison-based algorithm that sorts integers by counting the number of occurrences of each value.

8. **Radix Sort:**
   - Non-comparison-based algorithm that sorts integers by processing individual digits.

9. **Shell Sort:**
   - Variation of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart.

10. **Bucket Sort:**
    - Distributes the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort.

11. **Tim Sort:**
    - Hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data.

12. **Cocktail Shaker Sort (Bidirectional Bubble Sort):**
    - Variation of bubble sort where the list is sorted by comparing and swapping adjacent elements in both directions.

13. **Gnome Sort (Stupid Sort):**
    - Simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, similar to bubble sort.

14. **Odd-Even Sort:**
    - Variation of bubble sort where the list is divided into odd and even indexed elements, and elements at these positions are compared and swapped.

15. **Pancake Sort:**
    - Sorting algorithm that flips the elements of the array to sort it. The goal is to make the entire array sorted in just one flip.

16. **BogoSort:**
    - Highly ineffective and humorous algorithm that generates random permutations of the input until a sorted one is found.

17. **Cycle Sort:**
    - In-place, unstable sorting algorithm based on the idea of the cycle decomposition of permutations.

18. **Stooge Sort:**
    - Recursive sorting algorithm that is inefficient for large lists and works by recursively sorting the first two-thirds and last two-thirds of the list.

19. **Bitonic Sort:**
    - Algorithm designed for parallel processing that performs well on a parallel computer.

20. **Comb Sort:**
    - Variation of bubble sort with a wider gap between elements being compared and swapped.

Sorting algorithms vary in terms of time complexity, space complexity, stability, adaptability, and ease of implementation. The choice of which algorithm to use often depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data being sorted.
