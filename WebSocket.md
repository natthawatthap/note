WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. It is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers but can be used for any client-server or server-server communication. Unlike traditional HTTP communication, which is request-response-based, WebSocket allows for bidirectional communication between clients and servers.

Key features of WebSocket:

1. **Full-Duplex Communication:**
   - WebSocket enables simultaneous two-way communication between a client and a server. Both parties can send messages independently without waiting for a response.

2. **Low Latency:**
   - WebSocket reduces latency by eliminating the need to repeatedly open and close connections for each communication. Once the WebSocket connection is established, it remains open, allowing for faster communication.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - WebSocket reduces the overhead of HTTP by eliminating the need to send headers with each message. This makes it more efficient for scenarios where frequent communication is required.

4. **Binary and Text Data:**
   - WebSocket supports both binary and text data, allowing for the transmission of a wide range of data types. This flexibility is useful for applications that require real-time data updates.

5. **Cross-Origin Communication:**
   - WebSocket supports cross-origin communication, meaning that a web application served from one domain can establish a WebSocket connection to a server in a different domain.

6. **Security:**
   - WebSocket connections can be secured using encryption (SSL/TLS), ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data being transmitted.

7. **Event-Driven Model:**
   - WebSocket follows an event-driven model, where the server and client can respond to events, such as receiving a message or a connection closing.

8. **Subprotocols:**
   - WebSocket allows for the use of subprotocols, which are application-specific protocols layered over the WebSocket protocol. This can help in defining the format and structure of messages.

WebSocket is commonly used in scenarios that require real-time communication, such as chat applications, online gaming, financial trading platforms, collaborative editing tools, and live updates in web applications. It has become an essential technology for building interactive and responsive web applications.
