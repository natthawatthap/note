Channels in Go are a core feature used for communication and synchronization between goroutines. They provide a way for goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution by passing typed messages between them. Channels facilitate safe data transfer and coordination among concurrent processes in a Go program.

Key features of channels:

1. **Typed Communication**: Channels are typed, meaning they carry a specific type of data. Channels can be defined to handle specific types, such as integers, strings, structs, or custom-defined types.

2. **Synchronization**: Channels enable synchronization between goroutines. They ensure that one goroutine doesn't proceed beyond a certain point until another goroutine is ready. This synchronization prevents race conditions and ensures safe data sharing among goroutines.

3. **Unidirectional Communication**: Channels can be defined as either send-only or receive-only, allowing control over how data is communicated. This feature helps enforce restrictions on channel operations, providing more control over goroutine communication.

4. **Blocking Operations**: Sending data to a channel (`channel <- data`) or receiving data from a channel (`data <- channel`) are blocking operations. When a goroutine attempts to send data to a channel and there is no receiver, or when a goroutine tries to receive data from an empty channel, it will block until the operation can proceed safely.

5. **Buffered Channels**: Channels can be buffered, allowing a certain number of elements to be stored in the channel before blocking. Buffered channels enable asynchronous communication with a predefined capacity.

Example of using channels in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func sendData(ch chan int) {
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		ch <- i // Send data to the channel
		time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
	}
	close(ch) // Close the channel after sending data
}

func main() {
	dataChannel := make(chan int) // Create an unbuffered channel

	go sendData(dataChannel) // Start a goroutine to send data to the channel

	// Receive data from the channel
	for value := range dataChannel {
		fmt.Println("Received:", value)
	}

	// Alternatively, you can use for loop and select to receive data
	// for {
	// 	select {
	// 	case value, ok := <-dataChannel:
	// 		if !ok {
	// 			return
	// 		}
	// 		fmt.Println("Received:", value)
	// 	}
	// }
}
```

In this example, `sendData()` sends integers 1 to 5 into the `dataChannel` channel with a delay of 500 milliseconds between each send. The main goroutine then receives the data from the channel using a `for-range` loop. The program will block at the receive operation until all values are received, and then the channel is closed using `close(ch)` to signal that no more data will be sent.

Channels are a fundamental building block for concurrent programming in Go, facilitating communication and synchronization between goroutines and ensuring safe concurrent access to shared data.
