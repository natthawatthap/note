SSO stands for Single Sign-On, and it's an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications or services with a single set of login credentials. The primary goal of SSO is to simplify the user experience by eliminating the need for users to remember and manage multiple usernames and passwords for different systems.

In a traditional authentication setup, each application or service requires its own set of credentials. Users often need to remember various usernames and passwords, leading to potential security risks and usability challenges. SSO addresses these issues by enabling users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications seamlessly.

Key characteristics and components of Single Sign-On include:

1. **Authentication Provider:**
   - There is typically a central authentication provider or identity provider (IdP) that authenticates users. This could be an organization's internal authentication system or an external identity provider.

2. **Token-Based Authentication:**
   - Upon successful authentication, the user receives a token (such as a security token or session token) from the identity provider. This token serves as proof of authentication.

3. **Token Validation:**
   - When the user accesses another application within the same SSO ecosystem, the token is presented to the application. The application validates the token with the identity provider to confirm the user's identity and permissions.

4. **User Session:**
   - Once authenticated, the user session is established, allowing the user to move between applications without re-entering credentials for a predefined period.

5. **Single Logout (SLO):**
   - SSO systems often support Single Logout, allowing users to log out of all connected applications simultaneously.

6. **Security Standards:**
   - SSO implementations often rely on security standards such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to facilitate secure authentication and authorization.

Benefits of Single Sign-On include:

- **User Convenience:** Users only need to remember and enter their credentials once, making it more convenient and improving the overall user experience.

- **Security:** Centralized authentication can improve security by enforcing stronger authentication mechanisms, and it simplifies the management of user access and permissions.

- **Productivity:** SSO can enhance productivity as users can quickly access multiple applications without interruptions.

SSO is widely used in various contexts, including enterprise environments, web applications, and cloud services, contributing to a more secure and user-friendly authentication experience.
