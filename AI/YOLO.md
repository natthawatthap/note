YOLO, which stands for "You Only Look Once," is a real-time object detection system in computer vision. YOLO is an algorithm that can detect and recognize multiple objects in an image or video frame simultaneously. What sets YOLO apart from traditional object detection systems is its ability to perform detection in a single forward pass of the neural network, making it extremely fast and suitable for real-time applications.

Key features of YOLO include:

1. **Single Pass Detection:** YOLO divides an input image into a grid and, for each grid cell, predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously. This allows YOLO to detect multiple objects in a single pass through the neural network.

2. **Bounding Box Prediction:** YOLO predicts bounding boxes that tightly enclose the detected objects. Each bounding box is associated with a confidence score and class probabilities, indicating the likelihood of an object belonging to a particular class.

3. **Multiple Object Classes:** YOLO can detect objects from multiple classes simultaneously. The model is trained on diverse datasets with various object categories, enabling it to handle a wide range of objects.

4. **Real-time Performance:** YOLO is designed for real-time object detection in videos and live camera feeds. Its efficiency comes from its ability to process an entire image in one forward pass, eliminating the need for complex region proposal networks.

5. **Versions:** YOLO has undergone several iterations, with each version (e.g., YOLOv1, YOLOv2, YOLOv3, and potentially more) introducing improvements in terms of accuracy, speed, and model architecture.

YOLO has found applications in various domains, including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and object tracking. Its real-time capabilities make it suitable for scenarios where quick and accurate object detection is crucial.
