OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their credentials (such as username and password). OAuth allows users to grant temporary, limited access to their resources on one site to another site or application.

The OAuth protocol is widely used for enabling secure authorization flows in various contexts, particularly in the context of web and mobile applications interacting with APIs. It is often used to facilitate third-party authentication and authorization, allowing users to log in or grant permissions to an application using their existing credentials from another service.

Key components of the OAuth protocol include:

1. **Resource Owner (User):** The entity that can grant access to a protected resource. Typically, this is the end-user.

2. **Client:** The application making requests on behalf of the resource owner. The client can be a web application, a mobile app, or a server.

3. **Authorization Server:** The server that issues access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

4. **Resource Server:** The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

5. **Access Token:** A token representing the authorization granted to the client by the resource owner. The client uses this token to access protected resources on behalf of the resource owner.

OAuth comes in different versions, with OAuth 2.0 being the most widely adopted. OAuth 2.0 focuses on simplicity, flexibility, and being easy to implement. It is widely used for securing APIs and enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) in various application scenarios.
