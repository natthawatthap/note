Naming conventions for versioning can vary based on the project's needs and the versioning scheme adopted by the team or community. Here are some common best practices when naming versions:

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
Semantic Versioning is a popular versioning scheme that provides a clear set of rules and requirements for version numbers. It has the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR version**: Increments when you make incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR version**: Increments when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH version**: Increments when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

### Best Practices for Naming Versions:

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Adopt Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to ensure clarity and consistency in version naming.

2. **Clear and Understandable**: Use version numbers that are easy to understand and interpret by your users and contributors.

3. **Incremental Changes**: Ensure that version number changes reflect the nature of changes introduced. Increment version numbers accordingly based on the significance of changes made.

4. **Release Notes**: Accompany version updates with clear release notes or changelogs describing what has changed since the last release.

5. **Use Pre-release Tags**: For versions that are still in development or testing, you can use pre-release tags such as `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc` (release candidate), etc., to indicate the development stage of the version.

6. **Avoid Confusing Terminology**: Avoid using ambiguous terms in versioning like "latest," "current," etc., as they can create confusion over time.

7. **Automated Versioning**: In some cases, tools and CI/CD pipelines can automate version incrementation based on commit messages, pull requests, or other triggers.

8. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in version naming across different components or modules within your project.

9. **Community/Team Standards**: Follow any established standards within your development community or team, especially if you are working on open-source projects.

Remember, while Semantic Versioning is widely accepted and used, different projects or communities might have their own versioning strategies. It's essential to choose a versioning scheme that best fits your project's needs and clearly communicates changes to users and collaborators.
